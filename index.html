                The National Hockey League (NHL) is the largest professional ice hockey league in North America, consisting of 32 teams - 25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. Scoring is the cornerstone of the NHL, where the primary objective is to outscore the opponent by putting more pucks into their net. Throughout the league's history, scoring trends have reflected shifts in playing styles, rule changes, and strategies, from the high-flying offense of the 1980s, to periods of defensive dominance that stifled scoring opportunities and reshaped how the game was played. The Dead Puck Era, a time when goals became scarce due to a combination of defensive systems, lenient officiating, and the large sizes of goaltending equipment is a constant discussion online. Pinpointing the exact timeline of the Dead Puck Era is challenging due to varying opinions online, but I will determine through statistics of when I believe the era started and ended.
