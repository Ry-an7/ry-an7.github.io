            The National Hockey League (NHL) is the largest professional ice hockey league in North America, consisting of 32 teams - 25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. Scoring is the cornerstone of the NHL, where the primary objective is to outscore the opponent by putting more pucks into their net. Throughout the league's history, scoring trends have reflected shifts in playing styles, rule changes, and strategies, from the high-flying offense of the 1980s, to periods of defensive dominance that stifled scoring opportunities and reshaped how the game was played. The Dead Puck Era, a time when goals became scarce due to a combination of defensive systems, lenient officiating, and the large sizes of goaltending equipment is a constant discussion online. Pinpointing the exact timeline of the Dead Puck Era is challenging due to varying opinions online, but I will determine through statistics of when I believe the era started and ended.

    <h2>First I will explore the average number of goals scored across the entire history of the NHL.</h2>

            Exploring the season average of Goals Per Game across the whole history of the NHL, we can see that goals per game have fluctuated throughout the history of the NHL, with periods where the number of goals scored per game has been less than the overall average. The time period which I want to focus on is the year 1990-2023.

                From here, we can see that there is a significant drop off in average goals scored per game from the 1992-1999 season with the drop off being almost a goal per game (0.99 goals). There was a significant rise in the 2005-2006 season from the 2003-2004 season by half a goal (0.51 goals). The average goes back down after the 2005-2006 season, but it fluctuates up and down until the 2014-2015 season where it has consistently gone up since. The 2004-2005 season was cancelled due to a labour dispute and therefore has no data.

                Looking even closer, we can see that from 1997-2004 is the period where the average goals per game have been the lowest, with the 2003-2004 season having the lowest average goals per game at 2.57 goals per game. This time frame is what I identify as the Dead Puck Era.

        <h2>Let's look at total goals per season and see if that backs up what I have determined to be the Dead Puck Era.</h2>

                Looking at the overall history of league scoring, we can see that scoring is continuing to rise throughout the years, especially at the years when expansion took place (1967, 1980).

                Shrinking the time frame again to 1990-2023, we can see that most seasons in this range had more goals scored than the average of 6,400, but there is a significant drop of 3,354 goals between the 1993-1994 season and the 1994-1995 season. This drop off is not because of the change in number of teams, but because of another lockout that ended up having only 48 games played in the season instead of the normal 82 games.

                If we look at the total number of goals scored in a season from between 1994-2005, we can see that even though there were more goals scored than the average, the number of goals scored each season was less than 7000 goals which the 1993-1994 and 2005-2006 seasons surpassed.

        <h2>Now that the era is established, let's explore more about what happened</h2>
        
        <p class="desc">Let's explore to see if there is any correlation between overall season shooting percentage and the Dead Puck Era. Shooting percentage is a hockey statistic that measures how efficiently a player or team converts shots into goals. A higher shooting percentage indicates greater scoring efficiency, while a lower percentage suggests difficulty in converting scoring opportunities. It is calculated by dividing the number of goals by the number of shots taken. </p>

                Starting from the 1959-1960 season when shots were first tracked, there is a significant rise in shooting percentage from 1969-1981 followed by a slow descent from 1986-2015. From 2016-2024 there are signs that the shooting percentage is starting to go back up.
