# **Personal Portfolie Website**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a personal website created as part of **Assignment 2** for IAT 355. The main objective of the website is to showcase my skills, education, and experience in a professional manner, similar to an online portfolio. The website includes multiple pages, including a home page and multiple visualizations pages, each built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## **Purpose**
The website serves as a digital portfolio, highlighting my background, technical expertise, and visualization projects. It provides a clean, well-structured online presence, aimed at demonstrating the ability to build and design websites using front-end web development technologies.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3:** For styling the website and ensuring it has a professional appearance.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For adding interactivity to the website and handling form validation and SVG visualizations.
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** Used to create a custom visual artwork and a recreated version of a visualization covered in class.
- **Vega-Lite API:** Used to create visulizations from data from a video game dataset.


## **Project Structure**
The website consists of the following key files:

- **`index.html`:** This is the homepage of the website. It includes:
  - A personal introduction, where I highlight my education, skills, and experience.
  - Sections for my professional experience, technical skills, and interests.
  - Links to contact information and my GitHub profile.
  
- **`visualizations.html`:** A dedicated page to showcase visualizations. It contains:
  - An SVG version of a visualization created in class.
  - A creative custom SVG drawing I designed using code.

  - **`vegaLiteVis.html`:** A dedicated page to showcase visualizations created for Assignment 4 It contains:
  - 4 different visulizations created using Vega-Lite and data from a video game dataset.
  
- **`style.css`:** This file handles the layout and visual design of the website. It ensures that the content is presented in a clean and user-friendly way.

- **`main.js`:** This JavaScript file includes interactivity features like form validation and dynamic elements for the homepage.

- **`vis.js`:** Contains JavaScript code for rendering and interacting with SVG graphics on the visualizations page.

- **`vegaLiteVis.js`:** Contains JavaScript code for rendering and interacting with Vega-Lite graphics on the vegaLiteVis page.

- **`README.md`:** This file (you're reading it!) explains the purpose of the website, the technologies used, and how to navigate the project.

## **How to Navigate the Website**

2. **Visualizations Page (`visualizations.html`):**
   - This page features two main visualizations:
     1. An SVG version of the visualization created during class.
     2. A custom SVG artwork created for this assignment.
   - JavaScript-driven interactivity is embedded in the page to allow you to explore these visualizations.

3. **Vega-Lite Visualizations Page (`vegaLiteVis.html`):**
   - This page features four visualizations created using Vega-Lite in Observable and translated over to HTML and JavaScript for **Assignment 3**:
     1. A stacked bar graph visualizing Global Sales by Genre and Platform. 
     2. A stacked area chart visualizing Sales Over Time by Genre.
