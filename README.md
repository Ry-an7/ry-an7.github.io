# **FInal Project Website**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a website created as part of the **Final Project** for IAT 355. The main objective of the website is to tell a story about the NHL's Dead Puck Era using visulizations. The website is one page, but has interactivity that work with scrolling, all built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **D3**.

## **Purpose**
The primary goal of this project is to analyze how scoring in the NHL changed during the Dead Puck Era (1995-2004). We will examine trends in goals per game, explore the effects of the introduction of the salary cap, and highlight key shifts in offensive strategies during this time. The visualizations will make it easier to understand how these changes have shaped the game of hockey.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3:** For styling the website and ensuring it has a professional appearance.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For adding interactivity to the website.
- **D3.js:** For creating data-driven visualizations.

## **Project Structure**
The website consists of the following key files:

- **`index.html`:** This is the main page of the website. It includes:
  - A personal introduction, where I highlight my education, skills, and experience.
  - Sections for my professional experience, technical skills, and interests.
  - Links to contact information and my GitHub profile.
  
- **`vis.js`:** Contains JavaScript code for rendering and interacting with d3 graphics.

- **`style.css`:** This file handles the layout and visual design of the website. It ensures that the content is presented in a clean and user-friendly way.

- **`README.md`:** This file (you're reading it!) explains the purpose of the website, the technologies used, and how to navigate the project.

## **How to Navigate the Website**
