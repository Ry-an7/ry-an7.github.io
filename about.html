        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This website was created as part of the final project for IAT355: Introduction to Visual Analytics. Through six carefully crafted visualizations of hockey data, I aim to tell the story of the NHL's Dead Puck Eraâ€”how it emerged and its profound impact on the cornerstone of hockey: scoring. Additionally, I will examine the key changes that I believe contributed to the end of this era. This exploration delves into critical metrics such as the number of teams, goals scored, save percentages, and penalties called, providing a comprehensive look at the factors that defined and ultimately transformed this period in NHL history. Some questions I am to answer are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Was scoring significantly lower during the Dead Puck Era (1997-2004)?</li>
            <li>Did goaltenders benefit from this era through increased save percentages?</li>
            <li>What factors contributed to the end of the Dead Puck Era?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of these visualizations is to explore and analyze scoring trends in the NHL's history, with a particular emphasis on the Dead Puck Era. This project seeks to uncover how factors such as shooting and save percentages, goal-scoring rates, the number of teams, and penalties have shaped scoring dynamics. By offering insights into the evolution of offensive and defensive strategies, these visualizations will illuminate key periods of change and their lasting impact on the league. </p>
